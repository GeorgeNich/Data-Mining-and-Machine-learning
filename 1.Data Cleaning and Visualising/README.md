# Data Cleaning and Visualization

## Overview
This directory contains the materials for the 'Data Cleaning and Visualization' phase of the Data Mining and Machine Learning project, focusing on the Pima Indian Diabetes dataset. It showcases the process of preparing the dataset for analysis, including data cleaning and initial explorations through visualization.

## Contents
- [Data cleaning and visualisation_Data Analysis Project.ipynb](./Data%20cleaning%20and%20visualisation_Data%20Analysis%20Project.ipynb): A Jupyter notebook detailing the data cleaning and visualization process, including exploratory data analysis and visual representations of the dataset.
- [Pima_Indian_Diabetes_Analysis_Data_Cleansing_and_Predictive_Modeling.pdf](./Pima_Indian_Diabetes_Analysis_Data_Cleansing_and_Predictive_Modeling.pdf): An analysis report that accompanies the Jupyter notebook, providing insights into the methodology and findings.
- [diabetes.csv](./diabetes.csv): The original dataset used for the analysis, focusing on the Pima Indian population and diabetes prevalence.
- [readme.md](./readme.md): This file, outlining the contents and purpose of the directory.

## Data Cleaning and Visualization Highlights
- Comprehensive data cleaning to handle anomalies, missing values, and outliers.
- Detailed visualizations of key variables to understand their distributions and relationships with the target variable.
- Preliminary insights into the dataset through statistical methods.

## How to Use
- View the [Data cleaning and visualisation_Data Analysis Project.ipynb](./Data%20cleaning%20and%20visualisation_Data%20Analysis%20Project.ipynb) in a Jupyter environment for the analysis process and visualizations.
- Refer to the [Pima_Indian_Diabetes_Analysis_Data_Cleansing_and_Predictive_Modeling.pdf](./Pima_Indian_Diabetes_Analysis_Data_Cleansing_and_Predictive_Modeling.pdf) for an in-depth understanding of the methodologies and findings.
- Analyze or replicate the study using the [diabetes.csv](./diabetes.csv) file.

## Additional Information
- The dataset and analyses conducted here lay the groundwork for subsequent machine learning modeling.
