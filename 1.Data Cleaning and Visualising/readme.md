# Data Cleaning and Visualization

## Overview
This directory contains the materials for the 'Data Cleaning and Visualization' phase of the Data Mining and Machine Learning project, focusing on the Pima Indian Diabetes dataset. The contents showcase the process of preparing the dataset for further analysis, including steps taken to clean the data and initial explorations through visualization.

## Contents
- `Data cleaning and visualisation_Data Analysis Project.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook detailing the data cleaning and visualization process. This notebook includes exploratory data analysis, handling of missing values, and visual representations of the dataset.
- `Pima_Indian_Diabetes_Analysis_Data_Cleansing_and_Predictive_Modeling.pdf`: A comprehensive analysis report that accompanies the Jupyter notebook, providing insights into the findings and methodology.
- `diabetes.csv`: The original dataset used for the analysis, focusing on the Pima Indian population and diabetes prevalence.
- `readme.md`: This file, outlining the contents and purpose of the directory.

## Data Cleaning and Visualization Highlights
- Extensive data cleaning to handle anomalies, missing values, and outliers.
- Visualization of key variables to understand their distribution and relationship with the target variable.
- Application of statistical methods to gain preliminary insights into the dataset.

## How to Use
- Open the `Data cleaning and visualisation_Data Analysis Project.ipynb` in a Jupyter environment to view the analysis process and visualizations.
- Refer to the `Pima_Indian_Diabetes_Analysis_Data_Cleansing_and_Predictive_Modeling.pdf` for an in-depth understanding of the methodologies and findings.
- Use `diabetes.csv` for any further analysis or replication of the study.

## Additional Information
- The dataset and analyses conducted in this directory serve as the foundation for subsequent machine learning modeling.
