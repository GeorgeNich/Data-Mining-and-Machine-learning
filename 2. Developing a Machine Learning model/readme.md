# Developing a Machine Learning Model

## Overview
Welcome to the 'Developing a Machine Learning Model' section of our Data Mining and Machine Learning project. This directory is dedicated to applying machine learning techniques to the Pima Indian Diabetes dataset. Here, we focus on building, training, and evaluating models to predict diabetes, showcasing the power of machine learning in healthcare analytics.
